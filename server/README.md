# ProjectSkeleton

This is a reusable Node.js backend project skeleton for initializing new projects. It includes a basic folder structure for common backend functionalities, such as routing, middleware, services, controllers, and models.

## Getting Started

To use this skeleton for your project, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Database**: Depending on your needs, you can use a database like SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other supported by your ORM (like Sequelize).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   #```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ProjectSkeleton.git
   cd ProjectSkeleton

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

3. Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the env directory with the following content:

   PORT=5000
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   DB_PATH=./database.sqlite

### Running the Application

    1. To start the server, run:

    	npm start
    	# or
    	yarn start


    2. To start the server in development mode with nodemon, run:

    	npm run dev
    	# or
    	yarn dev

    The server will be available at http://localhost:5000.

### API Endpoints

    *. Authentication:

    	POST /api/auth/login: Login and receive a JWT token.

    *. Commission Rates:

    	GET /api/commissionRates: Get all commission rates.

    	POST /api/commissionRates: Add a new commission rate.

    *. Categories:

    	GET /api/categories: Get all categories.

    	POST /api/categories: Add a new category.

    *. Expenses

    	GET /api/expenses: Get all expenses.

    	POST /api/expenses: Add a new expense.

### Testing

    To run tests, use:

    	npm test
    	# or
    	yarn test

### Project Structure Explanation

    API Setup (api/): The api.js file initializes the application with the necessary routes and middleware. You can modify it to add more routes or integrate additional middleware.

    Controllers (controllers/): Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses. Start by creating a controller for each entity/resource in your application.

    Models (models/): Define your application's data structure using models. These are typically linked to a database schema and represent entities like users, products, or orders.

    Routes (routes/): Define the URL endpoints and route them to the corresponding controller. Each router handles a specific set of routes (e.g., user-related routes, product-related routes).

    Middleware (middleware/): Middleware functions process requests before they reach the controller. For example, authMiddleware.js checks for authentication tokens.

    Services (services/): Handle the business logic of the application. Services are called by the controllers to perform operations such as database queries or external API calls.

    Utils (utils/): Utility functions and helpers that can be used throughout the application. This includes reusable functions like validators and constant values.

### How to Extend

    Create New Models:
        Add new models in the models/ folder and define them based on your entity structure.
        Don't forget to update modelAssociations.js to define relationships between your models (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).

    Add New Controllers:
        For every new model, create a corresponding controller in controllers/. This controller will handle the HTTP requests related to that model.

    Add New Routes:
        Define new routes in the routes/ folder and map them to the respective controllers.

    Add New Services:
        Create new services in the services/ folder for handling the business logic associated with your new models.

### Environment Variables

Make sure to update your .env file with the appropriate variables for your setup. Here's an example of the kind of variables you might include:

PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://path-to-your-database
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
